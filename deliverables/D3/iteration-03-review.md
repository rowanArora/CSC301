 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration 03 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: November 11th 2023, 2:30 PM to 3:00 PM
 * Where: Online through Google Meet

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. What worked well

- Peer Code Reviews:
  - Instituting peer code review sessions encouraged knowledge sharing and reduced confusions.
  - This was useful as within our communications we would discuss certain parts of the code so related members know what's going on. Compared to previous group projects this greatly reduced confusions and everyone had the same goal in mind.

- Task Rotation for Skill Enhancement:
  - Implemented a task rotation system allowing team members to diversify their skills and gain experience in different aspects of the project. As we had similar skills we wanted a way for people to explore their interests and work on parts interesting to them
  - Feedback from team members in our weekly meetings suggests that this approach not only kept the work engaging but also contributed to a more well-rounded skill set.

- Student Collaboration Platforms:
  - Leveraging student-friendly collaboration platforms, such as Google Workspace and Discord, streamlined communication and document sharing.
  - We believe this worked as we kept all related documentation in a Google Drive folder so everyone was in the know of what is going on and what needs to be done. This made it very easy for everyone to get on and get work done without having to worry about any sort of setup and avoid confusions.

- Flexible Meeting Times for Student Schedules:
  - Adjusting meeting times based on the varying schedules of student team members enhanced attendance and engagement.
  - We think this because everyone has a certain time in which they are most efficient. We tried to accommodate everyone which led to more participation within the team and more enthusiasm.


#### Q2. What did not work well

- No Enforced Schedule
  - While having a flexible, easy-to-attend meeting structure meant we could maximize each team member’s efficiency when they knew what to do, we never enforced any mandatory meetings at a regular timeslot.
  - This meant that some of our time had to be used catching people up if they were behind on project developments or new goals the team had set, which was sometimes confusing and slow.

- No Github-Enforced Pull Request Reviews
  - When we merged branches to main, we never decided to make use of github’s approval mechanism that blocks branch merges until a certain number of team members review the code.
  - There were no major hang-ups with this, but when we did any refactoring across code previously from different branches, people got confused because no one had a working idea of what code they didn’t write themselves was doing (enough to easily move it around, anyways).


#### Q3(a). Planned changes

1. We are planning on sending out summaries of decisions we made and tasks we completed during our meetings to our Discord. We think this is a good idea because we like our flexible meeting structure and its efficiency benefits, but don’t want to have to deal with any extensive catching-up as a consequence of that system. This way, our team can continue to move forward effectively without accidentally leaving anyone stranded because they couldn’t make it to a more spontaneous meeting.


#### Q3(b). Integration & Next steps

We integrated the previously developed parts by first putting them into the main repo and having everyone take a look to see which parts were going to have to change. Due to the fact our final product wasn’t completely clear we had to discard some of the things developed in d2 and brainstorm with the team on how we can effectively integrate and change things. The assignment was useful in getting the groundwork setup so we had a place we could build off of instead of starting entirely from scratch.


#### Q4. How was your product demo?

- How did you prepare your demo?
  - We constructed a flow diagram that showcased how our api is called, and what it does during each step to highlight how the task was carried out.

- What did you manage to demo to your partner?
  - We managed to show both the flow diagram and demonstrated our api in action with test text data. We also showed the visualization of the data and how our database stores new information.
 
- Did your partner accept the features? And were there change requests?
  - Our partner was very impressed with the features we presented and was eager to implement them in their own api. However, they did request some changes, including adding a neutral option for the ml model and changing the output of the graph to a json for them. There weren’t many request to change things.

- What were your learnings through this process? This can be either from a process and/or product perspective.
  - Throughout this process, we learned that our product still has room for improvement. Though our partner has congratulated us on our effort, we know that we still have more work to do to work towards our final product.
